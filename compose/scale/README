This directory contains docker compose YAML files for creating a scale
installation with standard directory structure. 

In general, YAML files will assume that the configuration file root is at 
`/var/pryv/`. You should reference this directory as ${PRYV_CONFIG_ROOT} in the
docker compose files. 

You should find here: 

    core.yml      Compose file for launching a core machine.
    core/         Configuration template for the core machine. 
    reg.yml       Compose file for launching a registry machine. 
    reg/          Configuration template for the registry machine. 
    static.yml    Compose file for launching a static web machine. 
    static/       Configuration template for the static web machine. 
    
Configuration files are written for a test of the environment through the rec.la
domain. You will need to copy and customize the files for the client before
distribution.
